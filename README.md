# Intrusion Detection System using Reinforcement Federated Learning

## Overview 
This is a project dedicated to implementing an algorithm of Reinforcement Federated Learning using the Flower and Stable-Baselines Library. Other Federated algorithms were implemented in order to compare the results. The approach was Anomaly-based, identifying whether there is or not an attack. The federated model was also trained in 5 raspberry-pi using Ansible to manage the training.
